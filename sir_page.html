                <div class="profile-text">
                    <p><strong>Dr. Nalini K. Ratha</strong> is an Empire Innovation Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University at Buffalo (UB), which he joined in the fall of 2020. He is an expert in biometrics, computer vision, and trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on bias and fairness in AI systems.</p>
    
                    <p>Prior to joining UB, Dr. Ratha was a Research Staff Member at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, where he led biometrics research efforts aimed at enhancing the security and performance evaluation of biometric systems. During his 25-year career at IBM, he received several recognitions, including a Research Division Award, an Outstanding Technical Innovation Award, and was named an IBM Research Master Inventor in 2018. He holds over 85 patents as an inventor or co-inventor of various biometric innovations.</p>
                    
                    <p>Over the past few years, he has conducted several workshops on topics such as blockchain, biometrics, fairness, and trust in AI at major conferences like CVPR, ECCV, and ICCV. Notably, he co-organized a workshop on Trustworthy Vision Systems during CVPR 2020. He co-edited special issues of IEEE publications and served on the editorial boards of journals like Pattern Recognition and IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.</p>
                    
                    <p>Dr. Ratha is a prolific author and editor. He has co-authored the textbook "A Guide to Biometrics Selection and System Design" and co-edited several books, including "Deep Learning-Based Face Analytics," "Domain Adaptation in Visual Understanding," "Advances in Biometrics: Sensors, Algorithms and Systems," and "Automatic Fingerprint Recognition Systems."</p>
                    
                    <p>He has played significant roles in leading biometrics conferences, serving as general co-chair and program co-chair for events such as IEEE AutoID, SPIE Conferences on Biometrics, ICPR biometrics themes, CVPR workshops on Biometrics, IEEE Biometrics Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS), and the International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB). He served as the president of the IEEE Biometrics Council from January 2011 to December 2012 and currently serves as the Fellow Committee chair and member of the nominations committee for the IEEE Biometrics Council. He has also served on advisory boards for EU-INGRESS and EU-Fidelity projects and participated in several NSF evaluation panels.</p>
                    
                    <p>Dr. Ratha received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Michigan State University, and his B.Tech in Electrical Engineering and M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. He is a Fellow of IEEE, a Fellow of IAPR, and an ACM Distinguished Scientist.</p>
                    
                    <p>His current research interests include trustworthy AI, addressing fairness and bias in AI and vision systems, biometrics, computer vision, pattern recognition, and special-purpose architectures for computer vision systems.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Empire Innovation Program (EIP), which supported Dr. Ratha's recruitment, aims to enhance SUNY's research capacity by attracting faculty with strong research accomplishments in strategic priority areas.</p>
